Welcome to Protter — the open-source tool for interactive integration and visualization of annotated and predicted protein sequence features together with experimental proteomic evidence!

### Version 1.0 released!
The code for the final version 1.0 has just been released, check it out at GitHub (https://github.com/ulo/Protter).
A public instance of the Protter Server can be found at http://wlab.ethz.ch/protter/

### How to install your own Protter server on  Windows (XP or higher):
1. make sur you have an up-to-date Java runtime enivronment
2. download MiKTeX from http://miktex.org/download
3. install MiKTeX using default settings and make sure to select "Yes" for the "Install missing packages on-the-fly" option during setup.
4. download the complete Protter package from http://ulo.github.io/Protter/ and extract the archive to your local drive (e.g. "C:\Protter")
5. take a look at the "protter.config" file to configure the server to your enivronment
6. double-click the extracted "protterServer.jar" file and open your browser at http://localhost:81/

Note #1: The very first time your Protter server is asked to generate a protein visualization, a MiKTeX window will pop-up where you have to confirm installation of tex\latex\textopo\textopo.sty.
Note #2: The API to UniProt is changing every second month or so. If Protter gives you error messages regarding UniProt, shut down the Protter server, get the latest [uniprotjapi.jar](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/remotingAPI/) and copy it to the protterServer_lib subfolder (e.g. C:\Protter\protterServer_lib).
Note #3: To access you Protter server from other machines in your network, make sure to open the used port (81 per default) in the Windows Firewall.


### How to install your own Protter server on CentOS Linux 7
1. make sur you have an up-to-date Java runtime enivronment
2. Install a complete current texlive distribution
   a. First install texlive-dummy because centos' yum tex is out of date: 
      https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/texlive/texlive-dummy/EnterpriseLinux-7?lang=en
   b. Follow the texlive quick install instructions and install everything:
      https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html
   c. You will need to update your path to point to the texlive bin directory.  On a 64-bit system with the 2015 texlive distribution this will likely be accomplished as such:
      export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
3. Download the complete protter package from https://github.com/danielhyduke/Protter
   **Note, this is not the 'official' Protter repository.
4. From the command line, run: java -jar protterServer.jar
5. Point your browser to http://localhost:9991/
